__Abstract__
Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) early and cost-effectively is crucial. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have made accurate, affordable AD detection feasible. Yet, HIPAA compliance and the challenge of integrating these models into hospital systems limit their use. Addressing these constraints, we introduce ADetectoLocum, an open-source LLM equipped model designed for AD risk detection within hospital environments. This model evaluates AD risk through spontaneous patient speech, enhancing diagnostic processes without external data exchange. Our approach secures local deployment and significantly surpasses previous models in predictive accuracy for AD detection, especially in early-stage identification. ADetectoLocum therefore offers a reliable solution for AD diagnostics in healthcare institutions.
